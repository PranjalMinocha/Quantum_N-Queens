INTRODUCTION
------------

In this project, we implement a new algorithm to generate all solutions to the N-Queens Problem for a given N in polynomial time of order O(N3) and polynomial memory of order O(N2) on a quantum computer. We simulate the 4-queens problem and demonstrate its application to satellite communication using IBM Quantum Experience platform.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:

 * [Qiskit]
 * [TKinter]

EXECUTION
------------

 * Open N-Queens.ipynb in the Jupyter notebook interface.
 * In the 'Cell' dropdown menu, select 'Run all below' option to run the notebook.
 * Solutions will appear in a new figure window.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If the solution figure window does not display, check the following:

 * Make sure the images are in the same folder as the jupyter notebook
